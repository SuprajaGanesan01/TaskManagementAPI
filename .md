Installation & Setup

1.Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/TaskManagementApplication.git
   cd TaskManagementApplication

2.Configure MongoDB:

Make sure MongoDB is running locally on the default port (27017).
Database used: task_management.

3.Build and run the project:

./mvnw spring-boot:run
The application will start on http://localhost:8080 (or port set in application.properties).

4.Authentication:
Basic authentication is enabled. Default credentials:

Username: user
Password: password

Example JSON for creating a task:

{
    "title": "Learn Spring Boot",
    "description": "Practice CRUD APIs",
    "status": "PENDING"
}

Notes:

The id is auto-generated by MongoDB.
The createdDate and updatedDate are automatically handled.
Validation ensures that title and status are required.
